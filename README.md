# High Frequency Trading Solution #

### What is this repository for? ###
* automatic algorithm trading system

### How do I get set up? ###
* System requirement:
  based on centos 6.5 or 7 (other system have not been tested)
* IDE recommendation:
  I developed it by vim (using some cool plugin), i also set the neccessary config file for QT, so this can be opened on QT directly.
* Complie Tools
  based on g++, using the complie tools waf, the binary file is included in the repository, path hft/backend/bin/waf, for waf, you can google it
* pre-installed software:
  this project used zeromq to do ipc, version 4.1.2
* complie command:
  in the path of yourhomepath/hft, run "make", you will get binary file in build/bin
  
### Have a quick view ###
* How to run it
  As a start, you can run ctpdata (after 'make', ./build/bin/ctpdata), if network is good, and time is in the trading session(9:00-11:30 13:30-3:00), you can see marketdata come out in your screen.
* ui
you can find the frontend ui: https://github.com/nickhuangxinyu/Gallery/blob/master/TradingMonitor.rar
you can open it in trading time, it's a monitor of spread.

For the base part of strategy, I just make it as a dynamic library in external, ok to use, but code is not included
here, the reason is that something i am now still debugging, reconstructing, and thinking. if you have any questions
on this part, email me.
